## Description
This project analyzes real estate performance from 2022 to 2024. It highlights sales trends, client contributions, revenue by property type, and payment behavior, supporting smarter investment and marketing decisions.
## Problem Statement
Real estate firms often struggle to
- Monitor financial health across multiple regions and timeframes

- Optimize their marketing and sales strategies based on payment behaviors and seasonal performance
This dashboard solves these issues by offering real-time visual insights into financial performance, client activity, and sales distribution.
## Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Data modeling, DAX, KPI cards, interactive visuals)
- **Microsoft Excel** - raw data cleaning and formatting
- **Map visual** - for geographical revenue view

- Net Profit: **$66.6M**
- Properties Sold: **160**
- Total Expenses: **$29.6M**
- Total Price: **$117M**
## Key Insights
- Revenue trends are cyclical, with dips in February and October.
- Condos bring the highest revenue ($31M), followed by Single Family homes ($25M).
- Broker sales channels generated the most income ($40M), outperforming online and direct sales.
- Pending payments (39.29%) pose a risk to cash flow and financial planning.
- High-performing clients (e.g., Olivia Taylor, Jane Smith) repeatedly appear in top revenue lists.
